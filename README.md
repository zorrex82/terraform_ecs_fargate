In this repository you will find a code example to create an ECR repo with Fargate inside AWS using Terraform to deploy a Docker Image.
In the main file, all the necessary resources were placed, including IAM, Cluster and the Repo itself.
In the Backend an example of how to set to store the tfstate file directly in the S3 bucket, you will also find in the .github/workflow directory an example of CI/CD Pipeline configuration using GitHub Actions.

Enjoy!
